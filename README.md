# jpa2jdl
Parse existing JPA Entities classes (from .jar/.class) and dump jhipster JDL file.

To run: `gradle execute -Dargs='--packageName=io.github.jhipster.jpa2jdl.example.entities'`
# testing
For a slightly more comprehensive set of tests, we have taken the samples from https://github.com/jhipster/jdl-samples and will cross check the generated JPA entities back to the original JDL. See the unit tests for more details.
